This assignment main purpose was to incorporate CSS animations and Media Quries in creating a landing page for a fictional website. The theme/item that I choose to do this project was shoes. I included a nagvigation bar, header , sections and a footer. The nagvigation bar includes the different types of shoes that can be seen on the website and our contact information. In the header, I used the animation effect to welcome users to the site, in the sections I included images of the different types of shoes and below that some deals that will be offered if ordering and below that where we are located. In the footer, I created a copyright symbol and ended with a quote.

The page is easy to view and nagvigate through. Just click on where you want to go and oit take you to the desired sectiion.

I faced some challenegs with the animation effects but I did do some research and was able to figure which ones were better suited for this website. Overall this assignment was fun especially seeing the animation effects worked.
